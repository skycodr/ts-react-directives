# ts-react-directives

## About

**ts-react-directives** is a small React/Typescript library designed to mimic 'Angular' directives. This is not static library. It's meant to be used as declarative component. Also, it alleviates the limitations and cognitive complexity created by the ternary operations when using conditional rendering.
